# Supercell API Generator

A CLI capable of creating accounts (and APIs keys) on the APIs platforms of Supercell's games.

It allows the automation of the configuration of projects using these APIs, with a simple command that does not require any action from the user: the CLI uses a temporary email and generates random information for the name and password.
